      Factorio is a slow paced game in the beginning. If you are making a first look / preview video please consider to play the game yourself for some time (couple of hours). That should give you a good overview of what the game is really about (and also some experience :)).
    </p>

    <h3>General overview</h3>

    <p>
      Factorio is a game in which you build and maintain factories. You will be mining resources, researching technologies,
      building infrastructure, automating production and fighting enemies.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the beginning you will find yourself chopping trees, mining ores and crafting mechanical arms and transport belts
      by hand, but in short time you can become an industrial powerhouse, with huge solar fields, oil refining and
      cracking, manufacture and deployment of construction and logistic robots, all for your resource needs. However this
      heavy exploitation of the planet's resources does not sit nicely with the locals, so you will have to be prepared to
      defend yourself and your machine empire.
    </p>

    <p>Join forces with other players in cooperative Multiplayer, create huge factories, collaborate and delegate tasks
      between you and your friends. Add mods to increase your enjoyment, from small tweak and helper mods to complete game
      overhauls, Factorio's ground-up Modding support has allowed content creators from around the world to design
      interesting and innovative features. While the core gameplay is in the form of the freeplay scenario, there are a
      range of interesting challenges in the form of the Scenario pack, available as free DLC. If you don't find any maps
      or scenarios you enjoy, you can create your own with the in-game Map Editor, place down entities, enemies, and
      terrain in any way you like, and even add your own custom script to make for interesting gameplay.</p>

    <p>Factorio has been in development since 2012. It is our first and so far only game. We deeply care about its quality.
      That means: Gameplay is the king. No annoying bugs. Optimize for performance. Support and interact with the
      community. No DRM, pay once, get updates for free. </p>

    <p>The game runs on Microsoft Windows, macOS and Linux. Check the free demo or buy the game at our webpage.

    <h3>The Creators</h3>

    <p>
      <b>Wube (read woo-beh) Software</b> is a bunch of geeky developers and artists that bring you Factorio. Our office
      is located in Prague, Czech republic. Originally "a garage company" of 2 programmers with an interesting idea
      grew to a team of 16 full time professionals and
      contributors from around the world. The main people behind the project are:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Michal Kovarik</b>, aka <i>Kovarex</i> - Spent his childhood with computer games and programming. He
        started the project and is the creative heart of the team. Balances his time between programming the game and
        managing its development.</li>
      <li><b>Tomas Kozelek</b>, aka <i>slpwnd</i> - One of the project founders. He did many things from programming to
        managing the company. Nowadays active much less, only in bigger decisions and occasional consulting.</li>
      <li><b>Albert Bertolin</b>, aka <i>glex</i> - Art director and the main artist. He
        is perfectionist dedicated to giving the game the best factory visuals. Albert's summer passion is sailing in
        the Mediterranean. </li>
    </ul>
